# sstChat
unfinished local chat, i didnt know about git because i was learning, so i will add it entirely

doesnt work at all and im too lazy to fix it, i just have to change and add some constructors but im busy

to run the code you should run the .java located in /src/main/java/org/beast/addpersonalb/MainPSNL.java

if you want to execute the local server to make the chat work you should run the .java located in /src/main/java/org/beast/addpersonalb/guiLocalServer/chatServer.java, before executing the client chat, i made this entirely in java and didnt use any of the modern tools like maven, spring etc...

this app was made during my learning route in java, if you want to fix it, go ahead, ill be bery gratefull about it <3

muchas gracias por leer.
